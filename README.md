Title: The Padma Bridge


Introduction:
Proposal:
This work focuses on creating a computer graphics model of the Padma Bridge using OpenGL. The scene highlights the bridge, the flowing river, moving vehicles, trees, and other surroundings. The idea behind the proposal is to blend programming with creativity to a Padma Bridge simulation.

Description:
This project presents a computer graphics simulation of the Padma Bridge using OpenGL. The scene portrays a lively atmosphere with vehicles moving across the bridge, a train running on the track, a balloon floating upward, and clouds gliding through the sky. Along with these animated parts, objects like trees, shops, lampposts, and the river add depth and variety to the environment. Keyboard interaction allows users to control certain movements, such as toggling the cars or adjusting the train’s speed. The purpose is to create a realistic and interactive visualization that highlights the beauty of the Padma Bridge through motion and design.

24.	Car1 
25.	Car2 
26.	Car3 
27.	Train
28.	Baloon

Animation:
Animations are added to make the scene lively. Vehicles move across the bridge, the train runs along the track, clouds float in the sky, and the hot air balloon rises gently.
•	Car1 Car2 moving from right to left on the roads.
•	Car3 moves from left to right across the screen.
•	Cloud2 moves slowly from left to right.
•	Train moves from left to right across the screen.
•	Hot air balloon goes from bottom to upward.

Keyboard:
Keyboard inputs are used to control different animations. Specific keys can start or stop car movement, adjust train speed, or control the direction of the hot air balloon. 
1.	When the A key is pressed, Car1 and Car2 start moving from right to left, while Car3 moves in the opposite direction from left to right. Pressing A once more will stop all car movements.
2.	By Pressing the R key will reset train speed.

Mouse:
1.	By Pressing the LEFT key of the mouse will increase the train’s speed, whereas the RIGHT key will reduce it accordingly.
Merge:
The mouse is used to merge the five scenes, providing interaction in several ways. By clicking, the user can move between scenes. For instance, a left-click lets the user shift from one scene to another seamlessly.
